			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>The december of 2016 was a bit of a slow month for T29 so we opted to use that time to do a redesign of our site. The process myself, the design department and the marketing folks coming together to build something cool. Because our website is more often than not the first time a potential client interacts with us, our design department really wanted to nail the feel of the website. As such, this project came down to really nailing the details on development.</p>

			<h3>Approach</h3>
			<p> Because the existing Three29 website was already fairly built out, and we wanted to retain some of the content and styles we opted prototype many of the features we were hoping to include. This was an effective process for two reasons, the designer could get immediate feedback on how something felt which allowed us to tune earlier in the timeline or scrap an idea if it wasn’t working. The second reason is that it prevented any unforeseen challenges when I got to the build phase; the more complicated parts had already been handled or at least prototyped.</p>

			<h3>Action</h3>
			<p>Once we had the design a little more settled I started into the build process. This was tricky because I didn’t want to strip out the styles of scripts of the sections of the site we wanted to retain, but also wanted to avoid bloat and unneeded styles. I’d love to say there was a clever that I accomplished this, but the process was simply just to be hyper aware of what exactly I was changing. This is in contrast to other builds you are starting from a blank page; I had to consider and understand what was already built. Leveraging Advanced Custom Fields again helped me facilitate everyone in our company to be able to edit the site. </p>

			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>After extensive QA and tuning we were left with a site that our team was proud of. We were able to maintain our place in the google rankings, make our site look great and feel awesome. I’m proud of the product we made and my role in the process.</p>
