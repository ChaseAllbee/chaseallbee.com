          <h2>Our Process</h2>
          <p>We went directly to the source for more information: students. We interviewed a handful of students with ages ranging from 11 to 14. We probed for information on why they did or didn’t like math, how they understood it, and their feelings towards math learning. The information we gathered would be invaluable for driving forward our design.</p>
          <p>Our team was mostly comprised of other game design majors, so we tossed around various ideas for the design of our product that were all game related in some way. Taking the heuristics we found, we came up with various ideas but ended up landing on this: a mobile game that enables the player to play with the early concepts of algebra rather than making them learn formulas and processes. We decided to name this app Shapeshifter.
          </p>
          
          <p class="p-emphasize">We learned that the interviewees may not always give you exactly the information you were looking for, but often times gave us another very important point.
