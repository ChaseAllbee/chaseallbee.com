            <h1>Shapeshifter</h1>
            <p>Shapeshifter is the result of a class at UCSC focusing on research design. The purpose of our research was to find how math, anxiety, and delight were related to one another. In other words, we were looking at why adolescents have math anxiety and what we can do as designers to help address that.</p>

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>The scope of this project at the outset seemed fairly large, not only did we need to understand what math anxiety is but also get a handle on it well enough to create something to help ease it. With such a large task we decided to take it one piece at a time. The first problem was understanding what math anxiety is and how children see it.</p>


          <p>We decided to interview a handful of kids in our age range (12 - 14 years old). We tried to get a good cross section of kids as to not skew our data as well. Our team of five thoroughly went through what makes a good interview as well in an attempt to get the most accurate answers from the kids we were interviewing.
          </p>

          <p>Once we had conducted the interviews our group certainly felt like we had an idea of math anxiety, perhaps why some kids develop it, but not nearly the clarity we were seeking. So, we decided to go one step further and talk to teachers who are aware of and are actively trying solve math anxiety.</p>

          <p>The most valuable teacher interview came from a teacher who worked at a waldorf school in Sacramento. He not only was aware of math anxiety but had a good list of approaches to help children overcome it. Combined with the information we had gathered from the children and this teachers approaches we felt we could take a better look at creating some heuristics to inform our later design.</p>

          <h2>Heuristics</h2>
          <p class="first-paragraph">The heuristics that we gathered from the interview process were the following:</p>

          <ul class="paragraph-list">
            <li><strong>Enable cooperation between students</strong> - The students we talked to really didn’t like feeling like they were in their study alone. Some certainly suggested that they enjoy some time to reflect in quiet, but they also enjoyed collaboration. By connecting students learning to one another's, we thought we might be able to share the knowledge and hopefully the confidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Connect conceptual algebra they learn to the real world</strong> - The teacher we talked to suggested that he had had success in teaching algebra when he had grounded the concepts in real world examples. Rather than explain algebra as this vague and confusion concept of x’s and y’s, explain how slope shows up in real life, or how we use variables all the time but just refer to them with different names.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t force the student to do problems they don’t like upfront</strong> - Something that surprised us was that kids usually really enjoyed math if it was an exploratory experience. If they could take the problems in whatever order and whenever they wanted to, there was a sense of freedom that emerged. This allowed the learners to explore the math in a sense, rather than forced to trudge through it.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the math the main point of interaction, rather than hiding it</strong> - Kids can sense when a math game is trying to hide the fact that they’re learning math, or at least that’s what we heard time and time again in our interviews. We were looking for a math game that they enjoyed. While we didn’t get a laundry list of information there, we did get a hearty collection of math games that they didn’t like. The takeaway? Don’t pretend the math isn’t there, you know and the learners know that it is.</li>

          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>Our team was mostly comprised of other game design majors, so we tossed around various ideas for the design of our product that were all game related in some way. Taking the heuristics we found, we came up with various ideas but ended up landing on this: a mobile game that enables the player to play with the early concepts of algebra rather than making them learn formulas and processes. We decided to name this app Shapeshifter.</p>


          <p>Our team wanted to incorporate all the heuristics we had found, so making a digital game just made sense. We were able to allow players to engage with our game in teams, which encouraged collaboration rather than competition. We opened up a certain ‘world’ to a player and introduced concepts slowly but surely, then allowed them to explore that world and in turn that concept. This is in contrast to how tests are normally given or even how lessons are normally taught. To that end, we didn’t try to hide the math the player is doing. The more experienced player might tie the movements they see on screen to manipulating a graph through slope and offsets. However, someone who isn’t familiar with these concepts should just see a handful of mechanics that they need to acclimate to, just like any other game.

          <h2>Heuristics</h2>
          <p class="first-paragraph">At the end of the this project, our team was very proud of the product we had created and were given praise on our concept. One quote from our presentation compared our design as “the Helvetica of math games.” We also had some takeaways from this project that are important to note. Namely about the interviewing process. We learned that the interviewees may not always give you exactly the information you were looking for, but often times gave us another very important point. Secondly was the importance of rapid iteration on concepts. Our team tossed around a lot of great ideas, but the way we found our way to this one was through polishing all the things we thought were appropriate and quickly ditching anything that wasn’t worth it in the end.</p>
