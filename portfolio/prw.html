            <p>This is Please Rise, Winston, a game developed as part of my senior year game design course. At the core of this game was an experiment in user interface, narrative driven gameplay and the question of how language can influence a player's experience.</p>

          <h2>Concept</h2>
          <p>Please Rise, Winston puts the player in the shoes of a translator in a near future justice system. You can imagine the world they are placed into as one working towards the world of 1984, but not quite there yet. In the game, the player is tasked with translating the prosecutor or the defendant to the judge who is sitting behind the translator themselves. However, the translator player is the only person in the room who speaks all the languages.</p>

          <p>Rather than make a game that focuses on the semantics of translating, I wanted to make this game more about how malleable language can be. Thus, I chose to give the player many instances where a word can be interpreted as to what the speaker may mean. Whichever way the player chooses to translate something will effect the rest of the arguments set forth, so changing a word one place will effect words and sentences in later parts of the phrase. 
          </p>
          
          <p class="p-emphasize">This allows the player a certain amount of agency in choosing the defendants guilt or innocence and to that point allows them to craft a unique narrative.

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p class="first-paragraph">My role on this project was producer, designer, and coder. I ensured our team of seven were working well in conjuction with eachother and towards the common goal of completing our game. We employed the Agile Scrum process to make sure we were hitting our deadlines with grace. Our game was developed in C# within the Unity Engine to great success. Within a six month span we went from a blank document to being nominated for a Sammy award at UC Santa Cruz's annual Sammy Game Awards.</p>
