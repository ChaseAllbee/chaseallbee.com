            <h1>Hearth Helper</h1>
            <p>Hearth Helper is a project I’ve adopted in my freetime that aims to help players of the popular game Hearthstone more easily track their in game collection of cards. Hearth Helper was built by myself and Jonathan King with Ruby on Rails, Materialize, Hearthstone API integration and web scraping technologies.</p>

          <h2>Problem to Solve</h2>
          <p>When considering what project to work on together Jonathan King and I were talking about what problems actually present themselves to us that would be fun to solve. Both of us are avid players of the game Hearthstone and noticed that something the game was lacking was a way see what decks are popular and where you are in relation to owning them. Of course you can go find those sources on the internet, open a couple of tabs, and compare yourself, but this seemed like a fairly tedious solution to a simple problem. So, our end goal was simple,</p>
          
          <p class="p-emphasize">build a tool that would track your in game card collection to popular decks from the web and inform you how close you are to being able to build them
          </p>
          <p> However just because the goal is simple doesn’t mean it would be easy to implement.</p>

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p class="first-paragraph">Jonathan and I launched this project as a way to educate ourselves on a good handful of web-development topics. But, good god we really put ourselves through the ringer on this one. Here’s a short list of things we needed to do before we could finish this site:</p>
          <ul class="paragraph-list">
            <li>Build a backend with Ruby on Rails</li>
            <li>Have our frontend pull data from our Ruby database</li>
            <li>Build a web scraper to collect information from other sites (with their permission of course)</li>
            <li>Gather information from public API’s on Hearthstone Cards</li>
            <li>Become frontend wizards to make our site look fresh as hell</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The list of things we knew how to do at the outset of this project were</p>
          <ul class="paragraph-list">
            <li>Play hearthstone</li>
            <li>Analyze the speed of an algorithm (thank you college)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Needless to say we had some work to do</p>

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p class="first-paragraph">Disclaimer, for those of you who don’t care for the technical side of things you might want to skip down to the part where I show you the awesome end product; things are about to get nerdy. Jonathan had a background with Ruby on Rails so we decided to split the work up according to frontend and backend. I would handle most of the html/css/js and designs whereas he would implement the database with Ruby. So, the first thing I wanted to do while he was laying the foundation of our site was to figure out how to use any API’s that were available to us. Unfortunately, Hearthstone doesn’t have a public API for a user’s in game collection. That was a letdown, it would have made the flow of our web app a lot easier, but we didn’t let that stop us. What I did find was an API on mashape that had a frequently updated set of information on all the cards in Hearthstone. Hooray! No manually inputting all that information. I prototyped the flow of pulling that info, comparing it to a constructed deck and displaying that info on screen in codepen. Check it out! The real meat of the app is in the javascript on this one.
          </p>

      </iframe> -->

          <p>Having had some success with the API we then moved into building out some easier features of the site. Jonathan and I outlined what pages we would need and how best to present them. The bulk of this work was accomplished through a series of wireframes and low-fi mockups. We settled on keeping the site as minimalist and concise as possible. From there we moved into some simple html/css implementations. The easiest stuff came first for me: logged out homepage, login/signup and logged in homepage. It was all fun stuff, I really enjoy the process of taking static mockups and turning them into something real and interactable. While I was working on this Jonathan completed our web scraper that pulled info from the website Tempo Storm. Sidebar, this web scraper is cool as hell. It opened up Tempo Storm, found the most popular decks in their ‘Meta Snapshot’ and then pulled out the data about the cards within them. Super impressive stuff I was really excited to see accomplished. The final step in our process, which took a good while, was implementing all the features we had compiled. This meant displaying the info we scraped in the right place, making our web app easy to use, refining and refactoring. Once we had most of our features in place we gather some of the people we knew who played Hearthstone to test our app. We wanted to get a feel for where our site was easy to use, where it was confusing and where it was downright unusable. This informed us where we had room for improvement.</p>

          <h2>Lessons</h2>
          <p class="first-paragraph">A handful of really cool lessons came out of finishing this project. Of course on every project there is the technical advancement that comes with practicing building something. I’m always excited to better myself in that way, but that comes with every project; it’s the standard takeaway. However, here’s what was cool specifically about this project. The lack of available APIs from Hearthstone for a little while really discouraged Jonathan and I. We really didn’t know how to accomplish the goal we wanted to solve without it. There was a lesson here in not giving up when the challenge becomes greater than originally planned. It was tempting to call the problem too complicated or some other excuse, but we didn’t in the end. Now, one the pieces of feedback we received when testing was that people wished there was was a simpler way of inputting their cards into the collection manager (a problem that would have been solved by an API), so again it was tempting to call this a failure on our part. That may easily be the pessimist in me wanting to downplay the other accomplishments we did achieve, so I chose to believe something else which is the larger takeaway for me: there’s always room to improve, always room to tune and bring your projects closer to something “perfect”. I doubt that the idea of a perfect solution is something of a fable, but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t work towards it. All that being said, not being at the ideal of perfection doesn’t render our work inferior or the general “bad”. It’s work allowing that story to be the truth, but the more I do the more I get done and the better my products become.</p>
