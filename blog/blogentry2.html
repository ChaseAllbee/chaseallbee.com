        <p>I recently picked up Bloodborne. For the uninformed, no that isn’t a modern form of necromancy or devil worship. Although, I wonder if there’s room in the startup world for a warlock training program, maybe named demonswipe, deviloo, or some other such nonsense. No, Bloodborne is a video game. It’s a hard video game. It came out late last year and it’s following the success, and the aestic it seems, of the dark souls series which has come before it. Both game series ground themselves in a brutal level of difficulty. Now, this might seem like this sort of game could be unappealing to a lot of people, and while it’s not the best selling game of 2015, it’s still incredibly popular. There’s even been a wave of games coming on the Bloodborne’s success that pride themselves on that same sense of difficulty. Why? Conventional wisdom might suggest that people forcing themselves through something temporarily displeasing and prickly would drive them away. But, lo and behold the sales numbers of Bloodborne and the reviews as well. Both are fantastic. Again, why? Let’s figure it out.</p>

        <p>Bloodborne is punishing and unforgiving. However, in the same breathe it’s supremely satisfying and pleasing. There’s this sense that when you progress in the game, it’s only by the depth of your own grit that you got through. There is never a moment when you “get lucky”. Still, logic would hold that the type of person who would enjoy this type of game is one who can sit through difficulty, can weather the storm of temporary defeat and can persevere. To understand who this person is I highly recommend Jason VanderBerghe’s GDC talk about the 5 domains of play.  If you don’t have the time to watch it, the gist is that within each domain of play there are four kinds of players within that realm. He brings up challenge as a domain and says that there are players who are pulled more towards what he calls work play, skilled play, less skilled play and impulse play. He suggests that the niche found between skilled play and work play is this kind of player who wants to works incredibly hard to get through a game and does not mind putting in the work to get there. This really closely describes this kind of player who might be found playing Bloodborne and even calls out the dark souls series by name as representative of the kinds of games this person plays. Point being, there is a type of player who likes the uphill battle and enjoys the grinding to get to the top. The larger question now is, how do we apply this to UX?</p>



        <p>What we can extrapolate from these kinds of players is that there is a world where our UX challenges the user in some way. We work so hard in design to make our product easier and easier to the point where a brain dead chimp could bash their hands on a screen and still manage to log into facebook. 
        <p class="text-emphasis">My feeling is that some sort of tool should not purposefully be covered in a layer of difficulty, but that there may be value in setting up a rewarding interaction that is diffiuclt but not unfair.</p><p> Let’s take snapchat for a moment. If you haven’t used that app before and you just open it up, it’s going to look a little confusing. There isn’t much by way of explanation except a couple of buttons and some screens that don’t really explain what’s going on. Conventional wisdom might say that this is bad design, the user doesn’t immediately know what to do. But, for a moment lets overlay this Bloodborne ideology on top of it. The app doesn’t offer explaination but it’s point of interaction are clearly on screen. There’s only so many buttons, and when you end up pushing the one that’s in the middle of the screen you suddenly realize that it takes a picture. Cool! This interaction isn’t easy but it is fair. To that end, when you finally discover the use of the app, it’s rewarding you by progressing you further into the process. I think snapchat may realize this because everytime they update their app there is very little explanation. They simply drop features into the app and wait for people to discover them. You might say that snapchat is making bad design choices, but I really refuse to believe that a company that large doesn’t have enough UX folks to think about this sort of stuff.</p>

        <p>Now, I really think this sort of difficult/rewarding interaction shouldn’t be used all the time. You can think about it like a spicy plate of food. Put just a little spice on top and it may be bland and boring, but if you’re tossing ghost peppers on top of a some of french fries it’s going to turn people off. There will be a handful of bozos who demand to be fed this hurtful dish, but by and large you need to strike a balance. Use the idea of difficulty as a way to enhance your already satisfying product, but perhaps be wary of basing your entire model on it. Might need to suggest it to the people over at demonswipe, I’ve heard their UX team is full of old skeletons and warlocks, who historically haven’t been the best at desinging something pleasureable.</p>
