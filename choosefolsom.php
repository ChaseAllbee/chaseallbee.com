			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>Choose Folsom was developed for the Folsom Economic Development Corporation with the intention of modernizing the department’s consumer facing image. This was a part of the campaign that includes Visit Folsom, which was another site that I had hand in building.</p>

			<h3>Approach</h3>
			<p>The Folsom Economic Development Corporation came to us with a set of data and resources that they wanted to present in a modern and snappy way. A lot of the heavy lifting of this was on the design side. That being said I had to make sure that this site looked good on every device I could think of, have it be buttery smooth and easy to use.</p>

			<h3>Action</h3>
			<p>What helped me personally on this project was the new tech that we embraced moving into Choose Folsom. Firstly was a wordpress framework called Sage. It is not a wordpress template but rather a way of structuring your files and assets as to help speed up development. Sage also required the usage of gulp. The framework comes with a few gulp tasks built in (minifying css/js, compiling all our stylesheets, serving that to a dist folder, and browsersync) so it required that we use it. We also split up our css files into smaller compilable chunks of scss files. This also greatly helped my workflow. Rather than searching through one lengthy css file, I can simply go to the correct scss file and modify what I need to. With these tools in mind, building the theme was fairly straightforward. To that end, because of the modularity of the process another dev would be able to step in and take over with ease.</p>

			<h3>Lessons</h3>
			<p>I’m very proud of the work I put forth on this project. It was a blast to work on a site that I think looked so neat while still maintaining its purpose. We received feedback that choosefolsom.com exceeded expectations greatly.</p>
