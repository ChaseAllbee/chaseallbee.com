			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>Golden 1 Center was just about to celebrate a year of being open for business in the heart of downtown Sacramento. As such they wanted to highlight on a website the events that had taken place and some of the impressive statistics that they had gathered in the year since being open. This would be a build from the ground up, but with some fancy footwork on the frontend.</p>

			<h3>Approach</h3>
			<p>Golden 1 had their own designers internally so I was handed a photoshop document along with a website that was supposed to communicate how the website should feel. That website can be <a href="http://e03.epicurrence.com/">found here.</a> The main thing they wanted to ensure got through, was the feeling of inertia that happens when you scroll. This is also in conjunction with the parallax effect going on with some of the elements. Combined together this was a fair bit of javascript that needed to work, and work smoothly.</p>

			<h3>Action</h3>
			<p>I tackled this build in two phases. One: build the content in static form, without movement or fancy javascript. This was a challenge in itself because of the layout. If you take a look, the titles, text content and even the images you’ll see that they aren’t inline with a standard layout you’d expect on a site. So getting everything pixel perfect was an uphill battle. The second phase was getting everything moving. The first attempt I made got the feel of inertia close, but when the whole page started subscribing to that bit of scripting, the site slowed down to the point where it was almost unusable.That approach had leaned on using the background as a fixed element, which can be demanding on a browser. The second approach that I attempted was more efficient. Rather than using the background to scroll, I added a controller that would use the css translate property to move things around on screen. This still accomplished the parallax effect and take away the normal scrolling feature from the user. Take a look at the site to see the momentum scrolling in action.</p>

			<h3>Result</h3>
			<p>The site turn around was fairly quick and intense but at the end of the process golden 1 was incredibly satisfied. A direct quote from the director of marketing was that we ‘killed it’ on this build. I’m proud of how this site looks in that it’s really not your standard website but still manages to flow and feel like something familiar.</p>
